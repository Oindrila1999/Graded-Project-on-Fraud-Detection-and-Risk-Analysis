## Graded-Project-on-Fraud-Detection-and-Risk-Analysis

### Objective
#### This project aims to analyze structured and unstructured data to identify loan fraud, assess customer risk, and understand customer behavior for Cross River Bank. Leveraging MySQL for structured data (e.g., customer, loan, and transaction data) and MongoDB for unstructured data (e.g., customer feedback, behavior logs), the solution automates fraud detection and risk assessment processes.

#### The system identifies fraudulent patterns, optimizes lending policies, and enhances customer satisfaction by analyzing high-volume data effectively. This project demonstrates the integration of database technologies to solve real-world challenges in the financial domain. 

#### This repository contains the datasets, the problem statement, the solution of the problem tasks along with the comprehensive summary report of the analysis.
